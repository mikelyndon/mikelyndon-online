I want to see how much data I can move back and forth between Houdini 18.5 and UE4.26 using USD. In this first part, I prep[ the bar scene that SideFX provides](https://www.sidefx.com/contentlibrary/bar-scene/) to bring into UE4. Along the way I:

1. Setup the USD kind and purpose.
2. Create a proxy (realtime friendlier) mesh.
3. Show some PDG fun to batch convert a bunch of USD assets.
4. Dabble with python to fix transparent shaders.

Here's[ the hip file](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0i5e3Ubqr4fgeuS6oL6vPreUA#bar_scene_asset_prep_ue4) if you want to play
